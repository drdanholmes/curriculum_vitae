	abstract = {Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common form of secondary hypertension and is critical to identify because when caused by an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) or another unilateral form, it is potentially curable, and even when caused by bilateral disease, antihypertensives more specific to PA treatment can be employed (ie, aldosterone antagonists). Identification of unilateral forms is not generally accomplished with imaging because APAs may be small and elude detection, and coincidental identification of a non-functioning incidentaloma contralateral to an APA may lead to removal of an incorrect gland. For this reason, the method of choice for identifying unilateral forms of PA is selective adrenal venous sampling (AVS) followed by aldosterone and cortisol analysis on collected samples. This procedure is technically difficult from a radiological standpoint and, from the laboratory perspective, is fraught with opportunities for preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical error. We review the process of AVS collection, analysis and reporting. Suggestions are made for patient preparation, specimen labelling practices and nomenclature, analytical dilution protocols, which numerical results to report, and the necessary subsequent calculations. We also identify and explain frequent sources of confusion in the aldosterone and cortisol results and provide an example of tabular reporting to facilitate interpretation and communication between laboratorian, radiologist and clinician.},

	issn = {1916-0216},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of a standardized intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay in predicting postoperative hypocalcemia following parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective series of 66 patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral parathyroidectomy between January 2004 and June 2005.
SETTING: Tertiary care centre in Vancouver, British Columbia.
METHODS: Preoperatively, ionized calcium and PTH levels were recorded. A standardized intraoperative PTH assay was used to measure PTH levels on all patients at the following times: just prior to initial incision (Ti), just prior to adenoma excision (T0), and 5 and 10 minutes after excision (T5 and T10, respectively). Calcium levels were drawn at 8 and 16 hours postoperatively. Clinically significant hypocalcemia was defined as a symptomatic patient or a serum ionized calcium {\textless} or = 1.1 mmol/L.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative hypocalcemia following parathyroidectomy.
RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia was 12\% (8 of 66). There was no significant correlation between postoperative hypocalcemia and any of the evaluated factors, including intraoperative values of PTH (all p {\textgreater} .05). The percentage change between ioPTH at Ti and at T10 was, however, significantly associated with the development of postoperative hypocalcemia (odds ratio = 3.47 for a 10\% decline, p = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Percentage change in intraoperative PTH levels between the initial incision and at 10 minutes post-parathyroid adenoma excision is a significant predictor of postoperative hypocalcemia following parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism.},

Clinicians and patients need to interpret a multitude of medical measurements. These are often central to monitoring health and informed decision making. Has the serum cholesterol concentration come down since starting a statin? Have vitamin D levels gone up? Is the dose of thyroid medication correct? An understanding of the imprecision of medical measurements is essential to answer any of these questions. Even when laboratory and industry scientists have optimised their diagnostic testing processes to minimise inaccuracies, there always remains an error in any clinical measurement due to unavoidable, naturally occurring variability.

This practice pointer explains the nature of measurement errors and offers a practical guide to both estimating the confidence interval of a single result and deciding if changes between serial laboratory tests reflect true changes or simply fluctuations based on analytical or biological variation.

	abstract = {Bone marrow transplantation is the therapy of choice in patients affected by MPS I (Hurler syndrome), but a high incidence of rejection limits the success of this treatment. The deficiency of α-L-iduronidase (EC 1.2.3.76), one of the enzymes responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans, results in accumulation of heparan and dermatan sulphate in these patients. Heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate are known to be important components of the bone marrow microenvironment and critical for haematopoietic cell development. In this study we compared the ability of marrow stromal cells from MPS I patients and healthy donors to support normal haematopoiesis in Dexter-type long term culture. We found an inverse stroma/supernatant ratio in the number of clonogenic progenitors, particularly the colony-forming unit granulocyte–machrophage in MPS I cultures when compared to normal controls. No alteration in the adhesion of haematopoietic cells to the stroma of MPS I patients was found, suggesting that the altered distribution in the number of clonogenic progenitors is probably the result of an accelerated process of differentiation and maturation. The use of α-L-iduronidase gene-corrected marrow stromal cells re-established normal haematopoiesis in culture, suggesting that correction of the bone marrow microenvironment with competent enzyme prior to transplantation might help establishment of donor haematopoiesis.},

A better understanding of sterol lipid metabolism in individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) may help elucidate how this population’s unique metabolic characteristics influence their risks for atherosclerosis and AD. To revisit the question of whether sterol lipid parameters may be altered in DS subjects, we performed a pilot study to assess traditional serum sterol lipids and lipoproteins, as well as markers of sterol biosynthesis, metabolites, and plant sterols in 20 subjects with DS compared to age-matched controls. Here we report that the levels of nearly all lipids and lipoproteins examined are similar to control subjects, suggesting that trisomy 21 does not lead to pronounced general alterations in sterol lipid metabolism.

	abstract = {Context. Here we present a case of Amanita smithiana poisoning resulting in acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and highlight laboratory methods used to confirm the diagnosis. Identification of Amanita smithiana toxin using thin-layer chromatography can provide greater diagnostic certainty than history and renal function tests alone. Case details. A 63-year-old male presented to hospital with anuria and gastrointestinal symptoms, two days after consuming a soup of wild mushrooms he had picked. He was found to be in acute renal failure, requiring hemodialysis. After nine days of supportive treatment, he recovered renal function, and was discharged in good health 15 days post-ingestion. The patient provided a sample of leftover soup, and examination of cooked mushroom fragments by a mycologist provided preliminary identification of A. smithiana. Thin-layer chromatography revealed the presence of A. smithiana toxin in the soup, confirming this identification. Discussion. A. smithiana is a nephrotoxic mushroom that can be easily mistaken for the edible and highly prized Pine mushroom (Tricholoma magnivelare). It causes initial gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by acute renal failure. Treatment includes dialysis and supportive care until the patient recovers renal function. The chemical structure of the A. smithiana toxin is unknown, but it can be identified as a characteristic spot on thin-layer chromatography.},

Idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause followed by aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA or Conn syndrome), unilateral adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal carcinoma, and rare familial forms. Aldosterone excess results in sodium and water retention and potassium excretion, leading to volume expansion, concomitant hypertension, and variable degrees of hypokalemia. As the most common form of secondary hypertension, PA is recognized as an important public health concern. The diagnosis is infrequently considered despite widely available screening procedures. In addition to the hypertension, the negative effects of excess aldosterone are thought to be related to inflammation and fibrosis of various target organs. As a result, patients with PA are at increased risk of cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease compared with age-matched and blood pressure–matched patients with essential hypertension. For these reasons early identification and treatment are necessary to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with this curable form of chronic hypertension.},

While systemic GCs are often considered immunosuppressive, GCs in the thymus play a critical role in antigen-specific immunity by ensuring the selection of competent T cells. Elevated thymus-specific GC levels are thought to occur by local synthesis, but the mechanism of such tissue-specific GC production remains unknown. Here, we found metyrapone-blockable GC production in neonatal and adult bone marrow, spleen, and thymus of C57BL/6 mice. This production was primarily via regeneration of adrenal metabolites, rather than de novo synthesis from cholesterol, as we found high levels of gene expression and activity of the GC-regenerating enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), but not the GC-synthetic enzyme CYP11B1. Furthermore, incubation with physiological concentrations of GC metabolites (11-dehydrocorticosterone, prednisone) induced 11beta-HSD1- and GC receptor-dependent apoptosis (caspase activation) in both T and B cells, showing the functional relevance of local GC regeneration in lymphocyte GC signaling. Local GC production in bone marrow and spleen raises the possibility that GCs play a key role in B cell selection similar to their role in T cell selection. Our results also indicate that local GC production may amplify changes in adrenal GC signaling, rather than buffering against such changes, in the immune system.},

We present an HIV-infected patient with TDF-induced profound hypophosphatemia, Fanconi syndrome, osteomalacia, and bilateral hip fracture. Routine serum biochemistry was assessed by standard methods.

After 4 months off TDF, lumbar spine BMD significantly increased by 12 \% (Z score –3.5); by 6 months the plasma C-terminal FGF23 declined to 1.8 times the upper limit of normal, and both urine and serum phosphate levels normalized. By its marked elevation and subsequent near normalization, FGF23 may be responsible for a component of the phosphate wasting syndrome in these patients. The time course of resolution was 6 months.

	abstract = {Background
The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is based on the presence of an elevated serum calcium level. The study objective was to compare ionized calcium levels to serum calcium levels with respect to parathyroid hormone level (PTH) and several patient outcomes.
Methods
The study population comprised a retrospective cohort of 268 patients with PHPT who underwent primary parathyroidectomy. Serum calcium levels were compared with ionized calcium levels regarding their association with PTH level, presence of multiglandular disease, adenoma size, and extent of neck exploration.
Results
Serum calcium level was correlated with ionized calcium level (R2 = .68, 95\% confidence interval [CI], .56 to .79; P {\textless} .0001) and PTH was associated with both serum (R2 = .19; 95\% CI, .04 to .33; P = .012) and ionized (R2 = .23; 95\% CI, .07 to .38; P = .004) calcium levels. Ionized calcium level was a more sensitive indicator of PHPT because there was a greater incidence of ionized calcium being elevated without concordant serum calcium elevation than vice versa (P {\textless} .0001). Ionized calcium was also more linearly associated with adenoma size than was serum calcium (P = .0001). There were no differences between serum and ionized calcium levels in predicting the presence of multiglandular disease or the extent of neck dissection.
Conclusions
Serum calcium level is an appropriate first-line biochemical test for the diagnosis of PHPT. However, ionized calcium measurements may provide additional benefit in certain cases of PHPT because it is correlated with PTH level and adenoma size, and it may be a more sensitive marker of disease severity than serum calcium.},

	abstract = {Background
There is currently no consensus regarding the utilization of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) for predicting postthyroid surgery hypocalcemia. The objective of this study was to determine a threshold value for the 1-hour postoperative iPTH level that can identify those patients at significantly increased risk for the development of symptomatic hypocalcemia.
Methods
A prospective study of 21 individuals undergoing either total or completion thyroid operations was performed. One-hour postoperative iPTH levels were drawn along with ionized calcium at 6 hours postoperatively and at 7 am the following morning. Symptoms of hypocalcemia were recorded.
Results
Of the 21 patients recruited into the study cohort, there were 18 individuals that developed hypocalcemia (4 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic) and 3 that remained normocalcemic. The mean iPTH level 1 hour postoperatively was significantly different when comparing the normocalcemic, asymptomatic hypocalcemic, and symptomatic hypocalcemic patient groups (6.50 pmol/L versus 3.76 pmol/L versus 0.7 pmol/L, respectively; P = .007). An iPTH level ≤2.5 pmol/L was 100\% sensitive for predicting which individuals would go on to develop symptomatic hypocalcemia.
Conclusions
This study suggests that a 1-hour postoperative iPTH level ≤2.5 pmol/L can identify those individuals at risk for developing symptomatic hypocalcemia. Therefore, we recommend early calcium supplementation for these patients to decrease their postoperative morbidity from symptomatic hypocalcemia.},

	abstract = {Background To evaluate the accuracy and precision of a method for serum aldosterone using supported liquid extraction (SLE) for sample preparation instead of the more conventional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) approach.
Methods Two independently developed SLE-based LC-MS/MS methods for serum aldosterone (sample volumes 250 μl and 300 μl respectively) were compared to a modification of a previously reported LLE approach (sample volume 500 μl) in two method comparisons (n=75 and n=97). SLE analyses were performed at two separate centres. Precision was evaluated at a single site using human pools in head-to-head comparison between SLE and LLE. All analyses were performed on the ABSCIEX API-5000 LC-MS/MS system.
Results At four increasing pool concentrations spanning 67-1060 pmol/l, total precision for SLE ranged from 6.8-4.1\% compared with 11.1-4.3\% for LLE. Differences did not reach statistical significance except at the lowest concentration where SLE was superior. Pasing Bablok regression comparisons were SLE=0.96×LLE-5.8 pmol/l (R2=0.985) and SLE=0.96×LLE-0.44 pmol/l (R2=0.969).
Conclusions For analysis of serum aldosterone on the ABSCIEX API-5000, SLE affords a smaller sample volume while maintaining the accuracy and precision performance of LLE. By avoiding specimen vortexing, SLE also allows for greater automation in the sample preparation.},

It is commonly determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and, more recently, by relatively low-throughput LC–MS/MS methods. In order to circumvent the negative aspects of RIAs (radioisotopes, cross-reactivity) and the low throughput of LC–MS based methods, we have developed a high-throughput immuno-MALDI (iMALDI)-based assay for PRA determination using an Agilent Bravo for automated liquid handling and a Bruker Microflex LRF instrument for MALDI analysis, with the goal of implementing the assay in clinical laboratories. The current assay allows PRA determination of 29 patient samples (192 immuno-captures), within {\textasciitilde}6 to 7h, using a 3-hour Ang I generation period, at a 7.5-fold faster analysis time than LC–MS/MS. The assay is performed on 350μL of plasma, and has a linear range from 0.08 to 5.3ng/L/s in the reflector mode, and 0.04 to 5.3ng/L/s in the linear mode. The analytical precision is 2.0 to 9.7\% CV in the reflector mode, and 1.5 to 14.3\% CV in the linear mode. A method comparison to a clinically employed LC–MS/MS assay for PRA determination showed excellent correlation within the linear range, with an R2 value of ≥0.98. This automated high throughput iMALDI platform has clinically suitable sensitivity, precision, linear range, and correlation with the standard method for PRA determination. Furthermore, the developed workflow based on the iMALDI technology can be used for the determination of other proteomic biomarkers.

	abstract = {Essentials Activated clotting factor X (FXa) acquires fibrinolytic cofactor function after cleavage by plasmin. FXa-mediated plasma fibrinolysis is enabled by active site modification blocking a second cleavage. FXa-directed oral anticoagulants (DOACs) alter FXa cleavage by plasmin. DOACs enhance FX-dependent fibrinolysis and plasmin generation by tissue plasminogen activator. Background When bound to an anionic phospholipid-containing membrane, activated clotting factor X (FXa) is sequentially cleaved by plasmin from the intact form, FXaα, to FXabeta and then to Xa33/13. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) produces plasmin and is the initiator of fibrinolysis. Both FXabeta and Xa33/13 enhance t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation. Although stable in experiments using purified proteins, Xa33/13 rapidly loses t-PA cofactor function in plasma. Bypassing this inhibition, covalent modification of the FXaα active site prevents Xa33/13 formation by plasmin, and the persistent FXabeta enhances plasma fibrinolysis. As the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) rivaroxaban and apixaban bind to the FXa active site, we hypothesized that they similarly modulate FXa fibrinolytic function. Methods DOAC effects on fibrinolysis and the t-PA cofactor function of FXa were studied in patient plasma, normal pooled plasma and purified protein experiments by the use of light scattering, chromogenic assays, and immunoblots. Results The plasma of patients taking rivaroxaban showed enhanced fibrinolysis correlating with FXabeta. In normal pooled plasma, the addition of rivaroxaban or apixaban also shortened fibrinolysis times. This was related to the cleavage product, FXabeta, which increased plasmin production by t-PA. It was confirmed that these results were not caused by DOACs affecting activated FXIII-mediated fibrin crosslinking, clot ultrastructure and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activation in plasma. Conclusion The current study suggests a previously unknown effect of DOACs on FXa in addition to their well-documented anticoagulant role. By enabling the t-PA cofactor function of FXabeta in plasma, DOACs also enhance fibrinolysis. This effect may broaden their therapeutic indications.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
Clinical scientists frequently need to compare two different bioanalytical methods as part of assay validation/monitoring. As a matter necessity, regression methods for quantitative comparison in clinical chemistry, hematology and other clinical laboratory disciplines must allow for error in both the x and y variables. Traditionally the methods popularized by 1) Deming and 2) Passing and Bablok have been recommended. While commercial tools exist, no simple open source tool is available. The purpose of this work was to develop and entirely open-source GUI-driven program for bioanalytical method comparisons capable of performing these regression methods and able to produce highly customized graphical output.
Methods
The GUI is written in python and PyQt4 with R scripts performing regression and graphical functions. The program can be run from source code or as a pre-compiled binary executable. The software performs three forms of regression and offers weighting where applicable. Confidence bands of the regression are calculated using bootstrapping for Deming and Passing Bablok methods. Users can customize regression plots according to the tools available in R and can produced output in any of: jpg, png, tiff, bmp at any desired resolution or ps and pdf vector formats. Bland Altman plots and some regression diagnostic plots are also generated. Correctness of regression parameter estimates was confirmed against existing R packages.
Results
The program allows for rapid and highly customizable graphical output capable of conforming to the publication requirements of any clinical chemistry journal. Quick method comparisons can also be performed and cut and paste into spreadsheet or word processing applications.
Conclusions
We present a simple and intuitive open source tool for quantitative method comparison in a clinical laboratory environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
COPD is a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with oxidative stress. Serum bilirubin has potent antioxidant actions, and higher concentrations have been shown to protect against oxidative stress. The relation between serum bilirubin and COPD progression is unknown.
METHODS
Serum bilirubin was measured in 4,680 smokers aged 35 to 60 years old with mild to moderate airflow limitation. The relationship of serum bilirubin to postbronchodilator FEV1 and rate of FEV1 decline over 3 to 9 years was determined using regression modeling. Total and disease-specific mortality were also ascertained.
RESULTS
Serum bilirubin was positively related to FEV1 (P {\textless} .001). Serum bilirubin was also negatively related to the annual decline in FEV1 when adjusted for baseline demographics, pack-years smoked, and baseline measures of lung function (P = .01). Additionally, serum bilirubin was negatively associated with risk of death from coronary heart disease (P = .03); however, the relationships between bilirubin and other mortality end points were not statistically significant (P {\textgreater} .05).
CONCLUSIONS
Bilirubin is inversely related to COPD disease severity and progression. Higher serum bilirubin concentration was associated with a higher FEV1 and less annual decline in FEV1. Bilirubin was also associated with less coronary heart disease mortality. These data support the hypothesis that bilirubin has a protective effect on COPD disease progression, possibly through its antioxidant actions. Bilirubin may prove useful as an easily accessible and readily available blood-based COPD biomarker.},

Samples with IgG4 concentrations ranging from \&lt;0.03 g/L to 32 g/L were reanalyzed by LC-MS/MS, and a subset was also reanalyzed by Siemens IN (SIN) subclass measurements.Multivariate linear regression identified 3 subclass tests with multiple predictors of the measured subclass concentration. For these 3 subclasses, the predominant predictors were (in terms of LC-MS/MS IgG subclass measurement coefficients) BSIN IgG1 = 0.89·IgG1 + 0.4·IgG4; BSIN IgG2 = 0.94·IgG4 + 0.89·IgG2; and SIN IgG2 = 0.72·IgG2 + 0.24·IgG4.There is apparent IgG4 cross-reactivity with select IN subclass measurements affecting tests from both vendors tested. These findings can be explained either by direct cross-reactivity of the IN reagents with the IgG4 subclass or unique physicochemical properties of IgG4 that permit nonspecific binding of IgG4 heavy chain to other IgG immunoglobulin heavy chains. Irrespective of the mechanism, the observed intermethod discrepancies support the use of LC-MS/MS as the preferred method for measurement of IgG subclasses when testing patients with suspected IgG4-RD.},

Background and objectives Deficiency of essential trace elements and excess of potentially toxic trace elements are common in patients on hemodialysis. Whether these abnormalities are associated with poor outcomes is unknown but worth investigating, because they are potentially treatable.
Design, setting, participants, \& measurements We did a prospective longitudinal study of 1278 patients on incident hemodialysis, assessing blood concentrations of 25 trace elements at baseline. We used adjusted logistic regression to evaluate the association between trace element status and four outcomes (death, cardiovascular events, systemic infection, and hospitalization). A priori hypotheses concerned (1) deficiency of zinc, selenium, and manganese and (2) excess of lead, arsenic, and mercury. Concentrations of the other 19 elements were tested in hypothesis-generating analyses.
Results Over 2 years of follow-up, 260 (20\%) patients died, 285 (24\%) experienced a cardiovascular event, 117 (10\%) were hospitalized for systemic infection, and 928 (77\%) were hospitalized for any cause. Lower concentrations of zinc or manganese and higher concentrations of lead, arsenic, or mercury were not independently associated with higher risk of clinical outcomes. Lower concentrations of selenium were strongly and independently associated with death (odds ratio, 0.86 per decile; 99.2\% confidence interval, 0.80 to 0.93) and all-cause hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.92 per decile; 99.2\% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98). In exploratory analyses, higher copper concentrations were significantly associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio, 1.07 per decile; 99.2\% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.15), and cadmium levels in the highest decile were associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio, 1.89; 99.2\% confidence interval, 1.06 to 3.38).
Conclusions Lower levels of zinc or manganese and higher concentrations of lead, arsenic, or mercury were not associated with higher risk of clinical outcomes, but lower concentrations of selenium were strongly and independently associated with the risks of death and hospitalization.},

This assay has a Limit of Detection (LOD) of ∼10amol/μL (or ∼13pg/mL AngI and ∼11pg/mL AngII), at a S/N of 2:1, using only one-tenth of the antibody beads which were incubated with a 50-μL plasma sample. This LOD is within the relevant range of patient samples. Little or no angiotensin generation period is required, resulting in a rapid assay. Correlation coefficients for the standard curves are {\textgreater}0.99, with a linear range of 4–100fmol/μL (5–130ng/mL) and 100–2500amol/μL (106–2614pg/mL) for AngI and AngII, respectively. This duplexed assay can quantify AngI and AngII peptide levels simultaneously, in plasma from normotensive and hypertensive patients. The assay can detect changes in the levels of these peptides over time, which will allow quantitation of plasma renin and ACE activities.},

To aid clinical translation, these methods generally utilize a bottom-up strategy with isotopically labeled standards and a targeted form of MS measurement.Areas covered: This article reviews the status, challenges, requirements, and potential of translating current, MS-based methods to the clinical laboratory. The described methods are discussed and contrasted within a fit-for-purpose approach, while different resources for quality control, quantitative analysis, and data interpretation are additionally provided.Expert commentary: Although great strides have been made over the past five years in developing reliable quantitative assays for plasma protein biomarkers, it is crucial for investigators to have an understanding of the clinical validation process, a major roadblock in translational research.

	abstract = {Background:
Calculated quantities that combine results of multiple laboratory tests have become popular for screening, risk evaluation, and ongoing care in medicine. Many of these are ratios. In this paper, we address the specific issue of propagated random analytical error in calculated ratios.
Methods:
Standard error propagation theory is applied to develop an approximate formula for the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the ratio of two independent, normally distributed random variables. A method of mathematically modeling the problem by random simulations to validate these formulas is proposed and applied. Comparisons are made with the commonly quoted formula for the CV of a ratio.
Results:
The approximation formula for the CV of a ratio R=X/Y of independent Gaussian random variables developed herein has an absolute percentage error less than 4\% for CVs of less than 20\% in Y. In contrast the commonly quoted formula has a percentage error of up to 16\% for CVs of less than 20\% in Y.
Conclusion:
The usual formula for the CV of a ratio functions well when the CV of the denominator is less than 10\% but for larger CVs, the formula proposed here is more accurate. Random analytical error in calculated ratios may be larger than clinicians and laboratorians are aware. The magnitude of the propagated error needs to be considered when interpreting calculated ratios in the clinical laboratory, especially near medical decision limits where its effect may lead to erroneous conclusions.},

	abstract = {Object
Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the gold standard for localization of aldosterone producing adenoma. The anatomy of the right adrenal vein makes this procedure technically demanding and it may yield no clinical information if the adrenal veins are not adequately cannulated. Having frequently observed the technical failure of AVS, we undertook a review of 220 procedures in British Columbia, Canada.
Design and methods
Subjects were retrospectively identified through the laboratory information system. The following were collected: demographics, screening aldosterone concentration and renin activity/mass, results of dynamic function tests, AVS aldosterone and cortisol results. Standard calculations were performed on AVS data and site-specific success rates were compared. The effect of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation on the selectivity index (SI) and lateralization index (LI) were explored.
Results
The overall technical success-rate of AVS procedures was only 44\% in procedures where no ACTH-stimulation was used (n=200) but this rose significantly (p{\textless}0.01) to 82\% for those employing ACTH (n=139). ACTH-stimulation significantly increased the median SI (left: 5.8 vs 36.7, p{\textless}0.01; right: 7.0 vs 51.2, p{\textless}0.01), and salvaged 36 procedures from yielding no information, 21 of which demonstrated lateralization of aldosterone production. In 64 cases showing lateralization both pre and post-stimulation, ACTH significantly decreased the median LI from 5.4 to 2.2, p{\textless}0.01, creating substantial risk for spurious loss of lateralization.
Conclusions
The technical success of AVS is lower than reported elsewhere. Provided that effects on the LI are considered, the use of ACTH-stimulation during AVS assists in the identification of unilateral forms of PA.},

	abstract = {Plasma renin activity (PRA) is an essential analytical tool for screening and diagnosis of secondary forms of hypertension. Typically, PRA is measured by competitive radioimmunoassay, but there are significant drawbacks to this technique including non-specificity, long analysis times, narrow calibration range, and the requirement for radionucleotides. In this paper, we report a method for plasma renin activity determination by immuno-MALDI mass spectrometry detection. This method overcomes the issues of non-specificity and long analytical times present with RIA, and does not require the use of radionucleotides. As an initial methodological evaluation, plasma renin activity results obtained by radioimmunoassay, LC/ESI-MS/MS, and immuno-MALDI on 64 samples from an outpatient primary aldosteronism screening program have been compared. A strong correlation was found between immuno-MALDI and radioimmunoassay (R2 = 0.9412, 62/64 within the 95\% CI of the Bland-Altman plot), and iMALDI and LC/ESI-MS/MS (R2 = 0.9471, 62/64 within the 95\% CI of the Bland-Altman plot). Technical replicates showed a 4.8\% CV, while inter- and intra-day replicates showed CVs of 17.3\% and 17.2\% respectively. We have developed an assay capable of measuring PRA without the use of radionucleotides. This immuno-MALDI approach affords the specificity of MS while avoiding the long analytical run times and technical problems associated with HPLC. With the use of robotic sample preparation to optimize precision, this assay should be adaptable to clinical environments.},

Characterization of preanalytical effects unique to each method, platform, and patient population is important to prevent potential clinical misclassification.The Diagnostics Product Corporation (DPC) IMMULITE 2000 intact PTH assay is a solid-phase two-site chemiluminescent immunoassay with a monoclonal mouse capture antibody and a polyclonal goat signal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The effects of preanalytical factors on this assay have been partially investigated. Underfilling of EDTA-plasma tubes decreased measured PTH in samples from both healthy persons and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (11). Storage of SST serum samples for 3 days at room temperature decreased measured PTH in SST serum samples, an effect not seen with EDTA plasma (6). Results from EDTA plasma paradoxically increased after storage at 4 °C (12). Despite evidence that PTH is more stable in EDTA-anticoagulated specimens (5)(6)(7)(9)(10), the manufacturer describes an instability associated with EDTA-plasma samples and therefore recommends cold (2–8 °C) collection, centrifugation, and storage until analysis (13).},

	abstract = {Background
The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), defined as the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of plasma triglyceride (TG) to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), has been employed as a predictor of cardiovascular risk. We seek to quantify the analytical precision of the AIP using the coefficients of variation (CVs) of the TG and HDL-C assays.
Methods
Error propagation methods are employed to develop a simple formula for the standard deviation of the random analytical error in the AIP assuming that the errors in the TG and HDL-C assays are normally distributed. An alternative derivation assuming log-normal distribution of errors gives nearly identical results while avoiding subtle technical problems.
Results
The SD of the AIP is given by σAIP≅1ln(10)CVTG2+CVHDL-C2 and this formula will provide SD results that are accurate within 0.4\% for CVs of TG and HDL-C less than 5\%, as compared with results of Monte Carlo simulation. We also explain that the concept of CV cannot be applied to the AIP since it is a logarithm.
Conclusions
The formula provides a simple means to quantify the precision of the AIP from precision data available for the TG or HDL-C assays.},

We measured traditional clinical and laboratory risk factors, as well as newer biomarkers: cystatin C, high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL6), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin I and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Key outcomes were renal replacement therapy (RRT, dialysis or transplantation) and death, during the first year follow-up after enrollment: a time point important for clinical decision-making for patients and providers.Newer biomarkers do not improve the prediction of RRT, when added to conventional risk factors such as eGFR, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, hemoglobin, phosphate and albumin. However, in predicting death within 1 year, cystatin C, NT-proBNP, hsCRP and FGF23 values significantly improved model discrimination and reclassification: c statistic increased by absolute 4.3\% and Net Reclassification Improvement for categories of low, intermediate and high risk at 11.2\%.Our findings suggest that the addition of newer biomarkers may be useful in predicting death in patients with established CKD within a 1-year timeframe.

In addition, different tissues may independently regulate their local GC levels via local GC synthesis. Here, we find that in the mouse, endogenous GCs show tissue-specific developmental patterns, rather than mirroring GCs in the blood. Using solid-phase extraction, HPLC, and specific immunoassays, we quantified endogenous steroids and found that in tissues of female and male mice, (1) local GC levels can be much higher than systemic GC levels, (2) local GCs follow age-related patterns different from those of systemic GCs, and (3) local GCs have identities different from those of systemic GCs. For example, whereas corticosterone is the predominant circulating adrenal GC in mice, high concentrations of cortisol were measured in neonatal thymus, bone marrow, and heart. The presence of cortisol was confirmed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes was detected across multiple tissues, consistent with local GC production. Our results demonstrate that local GCs can differ from GCs in circulating blood. This finding suggests that steroids are widely used as local (paracrine or autocrine) signals, in addition to their classic role as systemic (endocrine) signals. Local GC regulation may even be the norm, rather than the exception, especially during development.},

We report the method-specific ARR cutoff determined with direct, automated chemiluminescence immunoassays allowing the simultaneous measurement of plasma aldosterone concentrations (PACs) and plasma renin concentrations (PRCs).
        Methods: 
        Method comparisons to commonly employed assays and tandem mass spectrometry were undertaken. Patients were previously diagnosed based on the local ARR cutoff of 1.2 (ng/dl)/(μIU/ml) in samples collected in upright seated position. Lack of aldosterone suppression in response to salt load to less than 5 ng/dl confirmed primary aldosteronism. For the new assays, the optimal ARR cutoff was established in 152 patients with essential hypertension, 93 with primary aldosteronism and 147 normotensive patients. Aldosterone suppression was assessed in 73 essential hypertensive and 46 primary aldosteronism patients.
        Results: 
        PAC and PRC were significantly correlated to values determined with currently available methods (P {\textless} 0.001). In patients with primary aldosteronism, patients with essential hypertension and controls, mean (95\% confidence interval) PAC was 28.4 (25.4–31.8), 6.4 (5.9–6.9) and 6.2 (5.6–6.9) ng/dl, respectively. In the same groups, PRC was 6.6 (5.6–7.7), 12.9 (11.2–14.8) and 26.5 (22.2–31.5) μIU/ml. An ARR cutoff of 1.12 provided 98.9\% sensitivity and 78.9\% specificity. Employing the new assay aldosterone suppression confirmed the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism and essential hypertension using the cutoff of 5 ng/dl.
        Conclusion: 
        Our data demonstrate that the new assays present a convenient alternative for the measurement of PAC and PRC on a single automated analyzer. Availability of these simultaneous assays should facilitate screening and diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
The laboratory has a critical role to play in the screening and diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. This review highlights some of the important analytical considerations and the new developments in the determination of aldosterone and renin.
Methods
The review considered the published literature and clinical practice guidelines in the area of primary aldosteronism.
Results
A brief introduction to primary aldosteronism is provided. A detailed description of the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical considerations for the laboratory determination of aldosterone, renin and the aldosterone to renin ratio follows.
Conclusions
The lack of internationally accepted standardized methodologies and standard reference material has impeded screening and diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. The development of more accurate and sensitive methods by LC–MS/MS has improved the reliability of aldosterone and renin testing and the availability of commercial chemiluminescent assays may improve the standardization of reporting. Laboratorians need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their analytical approach and ensure that their interpretative reports are appropriate to their assays.},

	abstract = {The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an essential role in the regulation of plasma volume and arterial blood pressure. One of the most common diseases of the RAAS is the autonomous production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, caused by either bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or an aldosterone-producing adenoma. This condition, known as primary aldosteronism, is a treatable and often curable form of hypertension. The measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA), as determined by radioimmunoassay for angiotensin I is essential to the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. However, accurate determination of PRA is often hampered by low plasma concentrations of angiotensin I. Here, we report the use of immuno-MALDI (iMALDI) as a highly sensitive and specific method for the absolute quantitation of angiotensin I in plasma. iMALDI permits concentration determination by affinity-capture of angiotensin I and a stable-isotopically labeled standard (SIS) peptide on immobilized anti-peptide antibodies. The affinity beads are placed on the MALDI target, permitting automated analysis of large numbers of patient samples. Pretreatment of the plasma is not required, and this method is suitable for the accurate determination of angiotensin I in whole plasma. The calibration curve generated using this method was linear over a 50-fold concentration range in plasma, with a correlation coefficient of 0.984. MS/MS sequence confirmation provides absolute specificity. The iMALDI angiotensin I assay, therefore, has the potential to be developed into a method for determining PRA that has advantages in time, in specificity, and in safety.},

We sought to examine the utility of this lipoprotein as a predictor of CVD outcomes in the HFH population at our lipid clinic.Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data from a large multiethnic cohort of HFH patients at a single, large lipid clinic in Vancouver, Canada. Three hundred and eighty-eight patients were diagnosed with possible, probable, or definite HFH by strict clinical diagnostic criteria. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to study the relationship between several established CVD risk factors, Lp(a), and the age of first hard CVD event.Results: An Lp(a) concentration of 800 units/L (560 mg/L) or higher was a significant independent risk factor for CVD outcomes [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.59; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.53–4.39; P \&lt;0.001]. Other significant risk factors were male sex [HR = 3.19 (1.79–5.69); P \&lt;0.001] and ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol [1.18 (1.07–1.30); P = 0.001]. A previous history of smoking or hypertension each produced HRs consistent with increased CVD risk [HR = 1.55 (0.92–2.61) and 1.57 (0.90–2.74), respectively], but neither reached statistical significance (both P = 0.10). LDL-cholesterol was not an independent predictor of CVD risk [HR = 0.85 (0.0.71–1.01); P = 0.07], nor was survival affected by the subcategory of HFH diagnosis (i.e., possible vs probable vs definite HFH).Conclusion: Lp(a) is an independent predictor of CVD risk in a multiethnic HFH population.},

Baseline PRA was measured in 2913 patients enrolled in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study. Subjects were followed for a median of 4.5 years. Compared with the referent lowest fifth, subjects in the highest fifth of the PRA distribution had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.38 (95\% confidence interval, 1.03–1.86; P = 0.03) for the composite of major vascular events, with an HR of 1.89 for CV death. These associations remained statistically significant after full adjustment for clinical characteristics, background use of beta-blockers, diuretics, allocation to ramipril, in addition to inflammatory biomarkers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide.High PRA is an independent predictor of major vascular events and mortality in a stable population of high-risk patients with atherosclerosis and/or diabetes. Although an increase in PRA could be a marker of more intense antihypertensive therapy, our results suggest that PRA may represent a risk marker and potential target for therapy in high-risk patients with atherosclerosis and/or diabetes.},

	abstract = {Background
Low concentrations and excessive concentrations of trace elements have been commonly reported in hemodialysis patients, but available studies have several important limitations.
Study Design
Random sample of patients drawn from a prospective cohort.
Setting \& Participants
198 incident hemodialysis patients treated in 3 Canadian centers.
Measurements
We used mass spectrometry to measure plasma concentrations of the 25 elements at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years following enrollment in the cohort. We focused on low concentrations of zinc, selenium, and manganese and excessive concentrations of lead, arsenic, and mercury; low and excessive concentrations of the other 19 trace elements were treated as exploratory analyses. Low and excessive concentrations were based on the 5th and 95th percentile plasma concentrations from healthy reference populations.
Results
At all 4 occasions, low zinc, selenium, and manganese concentrations were uncommon in study participants (≤5.1\%, ≤1.8\%, and ≤0.9\% for zinc, selenium, and manganese, respectively) and a substantial proportion of participants had concentrations that exceeded the 95th percentile (≥65.2\%, ≥74.2\%, and ≥19.7\%, respectively). Almost all participants had plasma lead concentrations above the 95th percentile at all time points. The proportion of participants with plasma arsenic concentrations exceeding the 95th percentile was relatively constant over time (9.1\%-9.8\%); the proportion with plasma mercury concentrations that exceeded the 95th percentile varied between 15.2\% and 29.3\%. Low arsenic, platinum, tungsten, and beryllium concentrations were common ({\textgreater}50\%), as were excessive cobalt, manganese, zinc, vanadium, cadmium, selenium, barium, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, lead, and chromium concentrations.
Conclusions
There was no evidence that low zinc, selenium, or manganese concentrations exist in most contemporary Canadian hemodialysis patients. Some patients have excessive plasma arsenic and mercury concentrations, and excessive lead concentrations were common. These findings require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background: Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) has been proposed as a potential biomarker of cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, this association remains controversial and has not been examined in a large clinical trial.

Methods and Results: We measured baseline PRA in 2913 high-risk patients with chronic stable vascular disease and/or diabetes enrolled in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) Study, and assessed its association with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality over 4.5 years of follow-up using a Cox proportional hazards model. The age and sex adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV death, all-cause death and heart failure were 1.15 [1.00 –1.32] (p=0.04), 1.15 [1.03–1.27] (p=0.01), and 1.15 [1.03–1.29] (p=0.01) respectively (median PRA 0.82 ng/ml/hr). Furthermore, this relationship remained significant after adjusting for baseline use of beta-blocker therapy, and for allocation to ramipril or placebo. Compared to the referent lower fifth of the PRA distribution, patients in the upper fifth ({\textgreater}1.79 ng/ml/hr) had a substantially higher age and sex adjusted risk for major vascular events (CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke), CV death, all-cause death and heart failure, with HR of 1.49 [1.09 –2.04] (p=0.010), 2.02 [1.21–3.37] (p=0.007), 1.55 [1.10 –2.19] (p=0.01) and 1.56 [1.02–2.38] (p=0.04), respectively. These associations remained highly statistically significant after adjustment for a risk score shown to reliably discriminate risk in the HOPE study population and which considers age, gender, smoking status, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes, prior stroke, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and microalbuminuria. These associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for treatment with beta-blockers and allocation to ramipril in the trial.

Conclusions: Elevated levels of PRA are associated with an increased risk of major CV events, CV death, all-cause death and heart failure in high-risk patients with stable chronic vascular disease and/or diabetes. PRA may thus represent a novel risk marker, and a potential target for therapy.},

	abstract = {Objective While sex differences in the treatment and outcomes of subjects with acute coronary syndromes are well documented, little is known about the impact of cardiac troponin (cTn) levels obtained in the emergency department (ED) on the observed sex differences. We sought to determine whether cTn levels by chest pain features modify sex differences in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in patients presenting with chest pain suggestive of ischemia. Methods All adults presenting to two hospitals in Vancouver, Canada, between May 2008 and March 2013 with ischemic chest pain and with cTn testing were included in the study. Outcomes were obtained through data linkage with population-based administrative data sets, including Vital Statistics (death), Discharge Abstract Database (hospitalizations), and PharmaNet (medications). Cumulative event rates for the composite major adverse cardiac event (MACE) endpoint (death, myocardial infarction [MI], incident admission for heart failure or for angina requiring diagnostic catheterization or revascularization) were estimated for each sex and cTn level using the Kaplan-Meier method; Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence interval (CIs) for 1-year MACE and 7-day catheterization. Logistic models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CI for 90-day medication use. Results Over the 5-year study period, 25,539 patients presented to the ED with chest pain of which 7,272 (2,933 females and 4,339 males) met the inclusion criteria. Among patients with chest pain with cardiac features/history and cTn {\textgreater} 99th percentile, females were less likely to be diagnosed with MI (46.4\% vs. 57.5\%). Females in the cTnI {\textgreater} 99th percentile group had the worst outcomes with a 1-year MACE rate of 22.7\% (95\% CI = 18.5–27.7) versus 18.8\% (95\% CI = 16.2–21.6), although this difference was attenuated and not statistically significant after adjustment for baseline differences. Overall, females underwent fewer diagnostic catheterizations than males within 7 days of admission to the ED. Even when cTn was above the 99th percentile and the chest pain was cardiac in nature, 48.4\% of females underwent a diagnostic catheterization compared to 64.3\% of males (p {\textless} 0.001). Within 90 days of discharge, females were less likely to use the evidence-based cardiac medications. The most striking sex differences were noted when cTnI levels were {\textgreater} 99th percentile and when the chest pain was cardiac in nature; males filled 25\% more prescriptions for statins than their female counterparts. Adjustment for baseline differences did not attenuate this difference. Conclusions Sex differences in diagnosis and treatment after presentation to the ED with chest pain are not explained by differences in chest pain features or levels of cTn. Even when females have cardiac chest pain and cTn levels {\textgreater} 99th percentile, they are less likely to be diagnosed with MI, less likely to undergo diagnostic cardiac catheterization within 7 days, and less likely to use evidence-based cardiac medications, but they have the highest 1-year MACE rate. The higher MACE rate appears to be driven by the higher burden of comorbid conditions.},

Regulatory standards mandate laboratories to perform studies to ensure accuracy and reliability of their test results. Method comparison and bias estimation are important components of these studies.
Design \& methods
We developed an interactive website for evaluating the relative performance of two analytical methods using R programming language tools. The website can be accessed at https://bahar.shinyapps.io/method\_compare/.
Results
The site has an easy-to-use interface that allows both copy-pasting and manual entry of data. It also allows selection of a regression model and creation of regression and difference plots. Available regression models include Ordinary Least Squares, Weighted-Ordinary Least Squares, Deming, Weighted-Deming, Passing-Bablok and Passing-Bablok for large datasets. The server processes the data and generates downloadable reports in PDF or HTML format.
Conclusions
Our website provides clinical laboratories a practical way to assess the relative performance of two analytical methods.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The study objective was to evaluate the intraoperative 50\% decrease in PTH level ± PTH normalization for its accuracy and efficiency in predicting cure during parathyroidectomy (PTx) for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP).
Methods
A retrospective review of patients undergoing PTx was conducted. The timepoints at which the 50\% PTH decrease was reached were recorded. The accuracy of intraoperative PTH for predicting cure, defined as normocalcemia at 6 months postoperatively, was evaluated.
Results
The study population was made up of 248 PHP patients, with 247 patients achieving normocalcemia at 6 months postoperatively. If a 50\% PTH decrease was used to indicate operation conclusion, 1 patient would not be cured. Persistent PTH elevation above normal range at T10 had a PPV of 77\%, NPV of 99.5\%, sensitivity of 95.2\% and specificity of 97.3\% for predicting the presence of a contralateral pathological parathyroid gland. For the study cohort, 24.5 h of cumulative operating time would be saved if the 50\% PTH decrease triggered operation conclusion.
Discussion
A decrease in the pre-excision PTH level to 50\% of the baseline level, or a decrease in the higher of the baseline or pre-excision PTH levels by 50\% at 5 or 10 min post pathological parathyroid gland removal, regardless of whether the PTH level normalizes, reliably predicts cure from PHP and should be used to guide the surgeon during parathyroidectomy.},

	abstract = {Background
Urine albumin (uALB) is a useful marker in diagnosis and treatment of renal microvascular disease. Beckman Coulter recently re-formulated their uALB reagent for the AU series of instruments to increase the analytical measurement range (AMR).
Methods
Precision, linearity, reportable range, and analytical sensitivity for the reformulated reagent were determined using the AU680. In addition, the re-formulated AU reagent was compared to the previous generation AU reagent and to the Siemens Vista using residual urine specimens. The hook effect was evaluated on five instruments by spiking serum into albumin-free urine to generate a range of albumin concentrations.
Results
Precision and linearity within the AMR were confirmed, along with accuracy of dilutions to extend the reportable range. For patient sample correlation, the re-formulated reagent demonstrated a positive 11\% bias relative to the original AU reagent and a negative 11\% bias relative to the Vista. Concentrations of uALB {\textgreater}3000mg/dL produced falsely low results for both AU reagents. The DCA Vantage assay “hooked” at even lower uALB concentrations.
Conclusions
The re-formulated AU uALB reagent met the manufacturer claimed performance characteristics. The AU and DCA Vantage were the only instruments of those tested affected by the hook effect in the concentration range evaluated. uALB assays are clearly not standardized, yet clinical guidelines dictate result interpretation. The method-to-method biases we observed here have the potential to lead to clinically significant post-analytical errors in uALB interpretation.},

	abstract = {Background: Allowable analytic errors are generally based on biologic variation in normal, healthy subjects. Some analytes like blood lactate have low concentrations in healthy individuals and resultant allowable variation is large when expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV). In Ricós’ compendium of biologic variation, the relative pooled intra-individual lactate variation (s i ) averages 27\% and the desirable imprecision becomes 13.5\%. We derived biologic variability (s b ) from consecutive patient data and demonstrate that s b of lactate is significantly lower. Methods: A data repository provided lactate results measured over 18 months in the General Systems intensive care unit (ICU) at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, Canada. In total 54,000 lactate measurements were made on two point-of-care Radiometer 800 blood gas systems operated by Respiratory Therapy. The standard deviations of duplicates (SDD) were tabulated for the intra-patient lactates that were separated by 0–1, 1–2…up to 16 h. The graphs of SDD vs. time interval were approximately linear; the y-intercept provided by the linear regression represents the sum of s b and short-term analytic variation (sa):y0=(sa2+s)b212.{\textbackslash}((\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{a\}\}\}):\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{y\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{0\}\}\} = \{(\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{a\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{2\}\} + \{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\{\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{b\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{2\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{\{1 {\textbackslash}over 2\}\}\}.{\textbackslash}) The short-term s a was determined from imprecisions provided by Radiometer and confirmed with onsite controls. The derivation of s b was performed for multiple patient ranges of lactate. Results: The relative desirable lactate imprecision for patients with lactic acidosis is about half that of normal individuals.

	abstract = {Background
Beckman Coulter has recently introduced a new troponin assay manufactured for the Access2 and DxI platforms, releasing it under the name AccuTnI+3. Clinical laboratories are required to validate method performance before testing and reporting patient results.
Methods
Beckman Coulter Access 2 instruments (n=42) across Kaiser Permanente Northern California were evaluated for their performance characteristics using the AccuTnI+3 reagent. Precision, linearity, and patient sample comparisons were performed on each instrument. Limit of the blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), serum plasma comparisons, and specimen stability were evaluated using a single instrument.
Results
The assay was linear from 0–100,000ng/L. The LOB, LOD and LOQ were determined to be 5, 8 and 20ng/L, respectively. Interday precision on the low QC (mean concentration 41ng/L) ranged from 3.0\% to 14.2\%. The bias observed between the former assay (AccuTnI) and the AccuTnI+3 was comparable to the inter-instrument bias for either assay. Non-uniform distribution was observed in the precision and inter-instrument/inter-assay comparisons among the instruments evaluated.
Conclusions
The AccuTnI and AccuTnI+3 troponin assays are equivalent across the analytical measuring range. There was no significant difference at the medical decision point. No changes in patient results are anticipated. However, the assay-independent inter-instrument bias observed is an important consideration for harmonization efforts.},

Universal screening of total bilirubin in neonates is endorsed by experts from the American Academy of Pediatrics and is increasingly common. Methodological differences between diazo-based quantitation (“wet” chemistry) and reflectance spectrophotometric quantitation (“dry” chemistry) can lead to unnecessary treatment. A recent recalibration of the only commercially available “dry” chemistry assay was issued to reduce these differences. This study evaluated the post-recalibration bias between the two assay types.
Methods
Method comparison of neonatal total bilirubin (Beckman AU680 vs Ortho-Clinical-Diagnostics Vitros) was achieved using freshly-drawn neonatal samples (n=239).
Results
The Vitros produced neonatal bilirubin results with a 12.4\% average positive bias compared to the AU680 total bilirubin results. The AU680 direct bilirubin reaction had 5.6\% cross reactivity with unconjugated bilirubin.
Conclusions
Neonatal or total bilirubin quantitation remains unharmonized between platforms. Care should be taken to understand the bias of specific platforms.},

	abstract = {Introduction. 2-butoxyethanol (2BE) is a solvent commonly incorporated into household and industrial cleaning products. Its ingestion causes rapid central nervous system depression, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis attributable to metabolism of the parent compound to butoxyacetic acid (BAA) by alcohol dehydrogenase. Lactic acidosis is also reported to develop in some cases. Published treatment strategies include the use of ethanol infusion, ethanol with concomitant dialysis, dialysis alone, and fomepizole. Case Report: We present an unusual case of a coingestion of ethanol and 150–250 mL of pure 2BE, which resulted in rapid obtundation, severe airway edema, hypotension, and prolonged acidosis despite the coingestion of ethanol and the administration of a loading dose of fomepizole. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis was employed to treat the acidosis. Ingestion was confirmed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometric determinaiton of 2BE and BAA. The patient recovered without sequelae. Conclusion. Alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors may not be adequate to prevent acidosis in significant ingestions to 2BE and extracorporeal treatments may be necessary.},

	abstract = {Background
The timing of intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurements during parathyroidectomy for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism is quite variable. Although a 50\% decrease after excision is considered predictive of cure, it is not known which combination of measurements is most useful.
Methods
Two hundred thirteen patients underwent resection of solitary parathyroid adenomas. Sex, age, intraoperative parathyroid hormone level at baseline, before adenoma removal (T0), and 5 minutes (T5) and 10 minutes (T10) after adenoma removal; and 50\% decrease were tested for associations with cure.
Results
A 50\% decrease in intraoperative parathyroid hormone level was 95\% sensitive for cure (95\% confidence interval, 89\% to 98\%) but did not predict cure for individual patients. A decrease into the normal range was not correlated with cure (P {\textgreater} .50). However, a 50\% decrease from T0 to T10 was 97\% predictive of cure (odds ratio, 6.5; P = .08).
Conclusions
The decrease in parathyroid hormone level from T0 to T10 during parathyroidectomy was most predictive of cure of primary hyperparathyroidism. A decrease into the normal range did not improve the performance characteristics of this test.},

	doi = {10.1097/HJH.0000000000001905},
	abstract = {Background: 
        Constituitively high and nonsuppressible aldosterone levels are considered to be the hallmark of primary aldosteronism. We observed a high proportion of primary aldosteronism patients with surprisingly low aldosterone levels in peripheral veins during adrenal vein sampling (AVS) and sought to further characterize the phenomenon.
        Methods: 
        Database analysis of patients with primary aldosteronism at the University of Calgary who underwent AVS under intravenous sedation. Aldosterone levels following sedation were compared with aldosterone measured at diagnosis in the free-living state. A validation analysis was performed on a similar database from the University of British Columbia.
        Results: 
        Seventy-two percent of 127 patients had AVS aldosterone levels more than 30\% lower than their outpatient aldosterone measure (468 vs. 278 pmol/l, P {\textless} 0.001). Thirty-nine percent of patients had aldosterone levels less than 200 pmol/l and 13\% had levels less than 140 pmol/l during AVS. Repeat analysis on the UBC cohort produced similar results with 88\% having an aldosterone more than 30\% lower than the outpatient measure (median aldosterone 568 vs. 201 pmol/l, P {\textless} 0.001).
        Conclusion: 
        A majority of primary aldosteronism patients have markedly lower aldosterone levels during sedated AVS compared with those found during outpatient diagnosis. In the absence of confounding medications, hypokalemia, circadian timing, postural variation and with low correlation to measures of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal activity, this suggests that many primary aldosteronism patients may, at times, have aldosterone levels that are surprisingly low–normal. This finding challenges the concept that a persistently high and nonsuppressible aldosterone level is a sine qua non of primary aldosteronism.},

	abstract = {Background: Elevated cardiac troponin (cTn), with signs/symptoms of ischemia, is a key element in a diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Underdiagnosis of MI in women has been attributed to atypical symptoms, inconsistent ECG findings, and less diagnostic testing. We sought to determine if there are sex differences in cTn testing following presentation to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of ischemic chest pain (CP) and if presentation affects diagnostic assessment.

Methods: All adults presenting to six hospital EDs in the Vancouver, Canada with a chief complaint of ischemic CP from 2009 to 2013 were included. The highest cTn level within 24 hours of ED presentation was used. CP was classified into cardiac- or respiratory dominant based on standard Canadian Emergency Department Triage and Acuity Scale coding. Chi-square testing was used to test for sex differences in CP categories and cTn testing within 24 hours. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between sex, cTn testing, and CP categories.

Results: Of 27,063 patients with ischemic CP, cardiac presentation was more common in men than women, irrespective of age. Among cardiac CP, 24.7\% of men were {\textless}50 years compared to 18.2\% of women; however, more women (19.9\%) than men (11.6\%) were {\textgreater}80 years. Overall, women were 1.8\% less likely to have cTn testing; in patients {\textless}50 years, testing was markedly lower in women compared to men [odds ratio, OR (95\% confidence intervals, CI) 0.78 (0.70–0.87)]. The odds of cardiac catheterization within 90 days of ED presentation were lower in women [OR, (95\% CI) 0.52 (0.44–0.63)]. Even with cardiac CP, 17.7\% of women versus 32.7\% of men had cardiac catheterization.

Conclusions: In men and women presenting to the ED with ischemic CP, cTn testing overall is similar except among young women under 50 years old, where it is markedly lower. Women undergo less cardiac catheterization, irrespective of CP type.},

Direct bilirubin is measured for the investigation of pediatric and adult jaundice. Package inserts suggest that hemolysis decreases direct bilirubin measurements, but no published studies have adequately described the extent of interference.
Methods
The influence of hemolysis on direct bilirubin quantification (Beckman AU680) was evaluated by titrating increasing amounts of hemoglobin into specimens with variable starting concentrations of direct bilirubin. An equation was derived to predict the nominal interference-free concentration of direct bilirubin as a function of measured concentration and hemolysis-index.
Results
Hemolysis decreased the direct bilirubin concentration reported by the AU680. The extent of interference is a function of both the interference-free concentration of direct bilirubin and the degree of hemolysis.
Conclusions
The concentration of direct bilirubin in hemolyzed specimens can be predicted.},

	abstract = {Background
We sought to evaluate the adequacy of follow-up of thyroid cancer patients at a Canadian centre.

Methods
We mailed a survey to the family physicians of thyroid cancer patients and analyzed the findings relative to follow-up guidelines published by the American Thyroid Association (ATA). Statistical significance between early and late follow-up patterns was analyzed using the χ2 test.

Results
Our survey response rate was 56.2\% (91 of 162). The time from operation ranged from 1.24–7.13 (mean 3.96) years, and 87.9\% of patients had undergone a physical exam within the previous year. Only 37.4\% and 14\% of patients had a serum thyroglobulin measurement within 6 and between 6 and 12 months before the survey, respectively. Thyroid simulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured within the prior 6 months in 67\% of patients and between 6 and 12 months in 13.2\%. The TSH levels were suppressed ({\textless} 0.1 μIU/L) in 24.2\% of patients, 0.1–2 μIU/L in 44\% and greater than 2 μIU/L in 17.6\%. Ultrasonography was the most common imaging test performed.

Conclusion
There is significant variation in the follow-up patterns of patients with thyroid cancer, and there is considerable deviation from current ATA guidelines.},

Beckman Coulter recently reformulated their commercial TSH assay with primary calibration to the World Health Organization 3rd TSH international standard. An extensive evaluation of the performance characteristics for this assay was completed.
Methods
Intra-day and inter-day precision was evaluated using 3 concentrations of commercial quality control material. Linearity, reportable range, stability, sensitivity and susceptibility to common inferences were determined using pooled patient specimens. Inter-assay variability was assessed across 5 different platforms (n=47 patient specimens).
Results
Intra-day and inter-day CVs were {\textless}10\% at all concentrations evaluated. The LOQ, LOD and LOB were 0.0047μIU/ml (10\% CV), 0.0012μIU/ml and 0.0005μIU/ml, respectively. Variable bias was observed for the TSH3 assay when evaluated against the previous generation assay and other platforms, but overall TSH3 gave comparable results.
Conclusions
The TSH3 assay for UniCel DxI 800, is precise, highly sensitive and comparable to the previous generation assay. The assay is acceptable for clinical testing.},

	abstract = {Background
Ezetimibe's mechanism of action, complementary to that of statins, makes it a useful therapeutic option in patients intolerant of lipid-lowering drugs or in those not achieving target lipid levels.
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe in a longterm follow-up of lipid clinic patients with emphasis on motivation for use and the impact on achievement of target lipid levels.
Methods
Two hundred and ninety-five clinic patients who were prescribed and took ezetimibe in the 13-month period following the drug's availability in Canada were identified from our database. Patients’ history and laboratory data were collected before and at first visit after the ezetimibe therapy was started. Paired t-test and chi-square test were used for statistical comparisons of ezetimibe's effect on lipid parameters and the achievement of target lipid-levels respectively.
Results
Ezetimibe treatment increased significantly the proportion of patients achieving lipid targets (by 25\% for LDL-C and by 21.7\% for TC/HDL-C) significantly by 18\% (p{\textless}0.001) and TC/HDL-C by 15\% (p{\textless}0.011). The effect of ezetimibe in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies was similar; LDL-C decreased by 22\% (p{\textless}0.001) and TC/HDL-C by 15.4\% (p{\textless}0.011). The same lipid-lowering effect was seen in patients with diabetes. In this subgroup, addition of ezetimibe to ongoing therapy led to three- and two-fold increase in LDL-C and TC/HDL-C target levels achievement, respectively. Only 7\% of patients discontinued ezetimibe treatment due to side effects.
Conclusion
In patients referred to the lipid clinic (typically because of side effects or failure to reach targets on other lipid-lowering therapy) treatment with ezetimibe significantly increased proportion of those achieving their target lipid levels. This was not accompanied by significant side effects.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Immunoassays and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays are commonly employed in clinical laboratories for measurement of total testosterone in serum. Results obtained from either of these methodologies compare poorly due to differences in calibration and/or inadvertent detection of interfering substances by the immunoassays. Standardization efforts are underway, but recent studies indicate that accuracy remains an issue.
Methods
This study compares the results from four independently developed and validated LC-MS/MS assays for total testosterone. The calibration for each assay was verified using National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 971.
Results
Initially, one of the four assays had a mean percent difference of +11.44\%, compared to the All Method Mean, but following re-verification of all five non-zero calibrator concentrations with the NIST SRM 971, the mean percent difference decreased to −4.88\%. Subsequently, the agreement between all four assays showed a mean bias of {\textless}5\% across the range of all testosterone concentrations (0.13–38.10 nmol/L; 3.7–1098 ng/dL), including at low concentrations of {\textless}1 nmol/L ({\textless}29 ng/dL).
Conclusions
Excellent agreement between four independently developed LC-MS/MS assays demonstrates that harmonization using standard reference material is attainable. However, as we found in this study, to ensure accurate calibration it is critical to validate the concentrations of new lots of calibrators.},

We demonstrate that reliable estimates of sb can be derived for virtually all constituents of the CBC from previously obtained paired patient results and summary QC data. Methods A laboratory data repository provided all of the outpatient CBC results measured over 20.5 months at a large Canadian referral laboratory. These CBC measurements were taken on one of four Beckman Coulter LH analyzers. A total of 1852 different patients had CBCs repeated at least twice within 84 h. We tabulated the pairs of intrapatient constituents that were separated by 0–6, 6–12, 12–18,… 72–78, and 78–84 h. The standard deviations of duplicates (SDD) of the paired data were then regressed against time. The y-intercept represents the sum of sb and short-term analytic variation (sa): y0 =(s2a +s2b)1/2. The short-term imprecision was determined from normal range Coulter quality control specimens. Results Patient sb for hematocrit, MCH, absolute monocytes, and absolute neutrophils are extremely close to those determined by biologic variation experiments using healthy volunteers. Most of the other estimates of sb tended to be slightly lower than literature estimates. Conclusions We describe a novel approach to deriving sb. The ratio of the sb to sa (a measure of sigma) indicates that the Beckman Coulter LH is extremely suitable for CBC monitoring of outpatients as well as for inpatients, whose sb is generally higher.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Approximately 35\% of cases of Conn’s syndrome (primary aldosteronism) result from a solitary functioning adrenal adenoma, and these patients are best managed by adrenalectomy. Postoperative hypoaldosteronism after unilateral adrenalectomy is uncommon.
Case presentation
We present a case and literature review of hypoaldosteronism after unilateral adrenalectomy for Conn’s syndrome, which demonstrates the insidious and sometimes delayed presentation.
Discussion
In this clinical case we summarize the previously published cases of post-adrenalectomy hypoaldosteronism based on a PUBMED and EBSCOhost search of all peer-reviewed publications (original articles and reviews) on this topic. A few cases of aldosterone insufficiency post-adrenalectomy for Conn’s syndrome were identified. The etiological factors for prolonged selective suppression of aldosterone secretion after unilateral adrenalectomy remain unclear.
Conclusion
It is important to be aware of the risk of postoperative hypoaldosteronism in this patient population. Close postoperative follow-up is necessary and strongly recommended, especially in patients with certain risk factors. Patients may need mineralocorticoid supplementation during this period.},

abstract = {Background
Thyrotoxicosis attributable exclusively to triiodothyronine (T3) is, by necessity, caused by accidental or intentional ingestion of pharmaceutical preparations. The clinical presentation of T3 overdose appears to differ from classic thyroid storm.
Case
A 30-year-old female patient presented serially to the emergency department with headache, nausea and vomiting. Neurological work-up was negative and she was treated for presumed viral gastroenteritis. Eventually she developed confusion and was admitted. Laboratory investigations showed a suppressed TSH and a free T3 above the linear range (>30 pmol/L), estimated by dilution in normal serum to be 330 pmol/L. She was diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis secondary to recently prescribed compounded liothyronine and was treated with seven rounds of plasmapheresis. Using a rapidly developed mass spectrometric method for T3, it was determined that compounding pharmacy had dispensed liothyronine at a concentration ≃1000-times the prescribed dosage.
Conclusion
The clinical and mass spectrometry laboratories played an essential role in the diagnosis of thyroid storm in this case of T3 overdose as the expected clinical features of hyperpyrexia, tachycardia and hypertension were initially absent.}

Although commercial solutions exist for the scanning and archiving of barcoded paper requisitions, the tools to accomplish this are freely available from the open source software community. We present a simple dedicated piece of software, Reqscan, for scanning patient laboratory requisitions, finding all barcode information, and saving the requisition as a portable document format named according the barcode(s) found. This Python application offers a simple solution to patient requisition digitization. Reqscan has been successfully tested and implemented into routine practice for storage and retrieval of outpatient requisitions at St. Paul's Hospital, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.},

	abstract = {Mass spectrometry in clinical laboratories has traditionally focussed on small molecule analysis making endocrinology applications a natural choice given the numerous diagnostic targets in the steroid family, many of which could be multiplexed. Over time, methods for lower abundance steroids were successfully translated meaning that almost all small molecule targets in clinical endocrinology could be performed using mass spectrometry. This has paved the way for standardization efforts which have ultimately forced the improvements in the immunoassay industry. More recently, however improvements in quantitative mass spectrometric protein workflows have permitted the translation of a number of specific protein targets into routine analysis. In addition to the benefits in analytical specificity, judicious selection of peptide targets has permitted simultaneous quantitation and phenotyping in some cases. Mass spectrometry continues to clarify previously unnoticed but significant analytical problems with commercial immunoassays and permits the investigation of interferences in individual patient cases on an ad hoc basis.},

	abstract = {Background
Beckman Coulter recently introduced a new hCG assay manufactured for the Access 2 and DxI platforms. This assay is the first to use the 5th International Standard (5th IS) as its primary calibration material. Clinical laboratories are required to validate the method performance before testing and reporting patient results.
Methods
Beckman Coulter Access 2 instruments (n=41) across Kaiser Permanente Northern California were evaluated for their performance characteristics using the hCG5 reagent. Precision, linearity, dilution verification, and patient sample comparisons were performed on each instrument.
Results
The assay was linear up to 1350IU/L. Intra-day and inter-day precision ranged from 1.0\%–3.3\% and 1.8–7.3\%, respectively, for the low QC material (mean concentration 4.6IU/L). Percent bias between the previous assay (hCG2) and the hCG5 assay was 3.2 to 22.7\% for hCG concentrations {\textless}1000IU/L and −2.9 to 30\% for concentrations {\textgreater}1000IU/L. On board and manual dilutions agreed within 15\% following proper adjustment of the instrument dilution factor.
Conclusions
Achieving Access 2 inter-instrument agreement on specimens needing dilutions (hCG{\textgreater}1350IU/L) requires validation of the on board dilution factor. Laboratories should use QC material above the linear range to monitor instrument dilution accuracy and precision.},

With the rising complexity of modern multimarker analytical techniques and notable scientific publication retractions required for erroneous statistical analysis, there is increasing awareness of the importance of research transparency and reproducibility. The development of mature open-source tools for literate programming in multiple langauge paradigms has made fully-reproducible authorship possible.
Objectives
We describe the procedure for manuscript preparation using RMarkdown and the R statistical programming language with application to JMSACL or any other Elsevier journal.
Methods
An instructional manuscript has been prepared in the RMarkdown markup language with stepwise directions on preparing sections, subsections, lists, tables, figures and reference management in an entirely reproducible format.
Results
From RMarkdown code, a submission-ready PDF is generated and JMSACL-compatible LaTeX code is generated. These can be uploaded to the Editorial Manager.
Conclusion
A completely reproducible manuscript preparation pipeline using the R and RMarkdown is described.},
