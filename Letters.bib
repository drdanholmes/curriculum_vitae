However, in order to understand whether serum IgG2 concentrations are significantly associated with the presence and severity of IgG4-RD in this case, or any other, requires the use of an IgG subclass method, such as mass spectrometry, which has been documented as free from error in the setting of high IgG4 concentrations [4].In addition, this article highlights the need to reconsider the diagnosis of IgG4-RD in patients who were historically assessed as unlikely to have the disease, on the basis of a low serum IgG4 concentration (that was potentially affected by the error of antigen excess).},

	abstract = {Specimen lipemia is a primary concern with turbidimetric and nephelometric assays due the potential interference caused by light scattering or absorption. The purpose of this study was to evaluate lipemic interference thresholds across seven FDA-cleared assays using patient specimens with varying degrees of endogenous lipemia pre- and post-ultracentrifugation (UC) and with Intralipid spiking.
Using an IRB-approved protocol, residual human serum specimens (n=42; L-indices, 1-1769; H-index ≤85; I-index ≤2) were obtained. Baseline and post-UC testing was conducted across assays on cobas c502 and c702 instruments (Roche Diagnostics; Indianapolis, IN). Serum indices and triglyceride (TRIG) concentrations were also measured pre- and post-UC. Intralipid spiking studies with human AB serum were also conducted. Lipoprotein subfraction analysis (Lipoprint; Quantimetrix; Redondo Beach, CA) was performed on three additional patient specimens with elevated TRIG post-UC to determine which TRIG-containing lipoprotein fraction(s) remain.
Several assays showed L-index thresholds derived from endogenously lipemic specimens that were below previously defined limits from the package inserts (PIs) [new (prior)]: AAT 400 (500); CERU 100 (200); HAPTO 450 (600); TRSF 250 (500). L-index limits derived from Intralipid spiking were generally higher than those listed in PIs. UC did not adversely impact results in non-lipemic or lipemic specimens. UC was effective at clearing lipemic interference, although persistence of residual VLDL was often observed.
This study provides an analysis of L-index thresholds for seven immunoturbidimetric assays. Due to the variety of human lipoproteins, limits defined using endogenously lipemic patient specimens may be different from those derived from spiking studies using Intralipid.
Clinical decisions in patients with monoclonal gammopathies may be highly imprecise because of variations of parameters used in diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to calculate the variation in M-protein, free light chains (FLCs), and immunoglobulins in respective patients.
We analyzed the data of clinically stable patients with monoclonal gammopathy (MG), which were monitored for 7-years to determine the biological variations and reference change values (RCV) of serum M-protein, monoclonal serum FLCs and immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations. Patients that were included in the study had no change in diagnosis and showed {\textless}5 g/L change in serum M-protein during the monitoring. From the patients included at least 3 consecutive samples were analyzed within 8 months and 7 years of initial diagnosis.
The total coefficient of variations (CV) was calculated for M-protein and involved/uninvolved fractions of FLCs and immunoglobulins. From 38 patients and 456 samples that were included in the study, the total CVs were calculated for serial M-proteins (8.9\%), serum involved FLCs (iFLC, 21.4\%), involved Ig (i-Ig, 8.7\%) and uninvolved Ig (u-Ig, 9.1\%). Combining these CVs and the interassay analytical CVs, we calculated the biological CV for the serum M-protein (8.4\%), serum iFLC concentration (21.1\%), i-Ig (8.6\%) and u-Ig (9.0\%). A significant correlation was found in multiple myeloma patients between the κ/λ light chain ratio (rFLC) with i-Ig, the difference between i-Ig level and u-Ig level (d-Ig) and ratio Ig (r-Ig) (r = 0.790, 0.703 and 0.711, respectively). These correlations were not found in patients suffering from MG of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma.
i-Ig determinations may be an alternative to M-protein for MGs. The variations in serum FLC measurements during MG monitoring were greater than those observed in serum M-proteins and therefore need to be more rigorously revised for recommendations.
The heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 (GPC1) is involved in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis and is overexpressed frequently in tumor and endothelial cells (ECs) in human gliomas. We demonstrated previously that in brain EC, GPC1 regulates mitotic cyclins and securin as well as mitosis and that GPC1 is required for progression through the cell cycle. To characterize the molecular mechanism underlying cell cycle regulation by GPC1, we systematically investigated its effects on key G1/S checkpoint regulators and on major signaling pathways reportedly activated by Dally (Division abnormally delayed) the Drosophila GPC1 homologue. We found that elevated GPC1 affected a wide range of G1/S checkpoint regulators, leading to inactivation of the G1/S checkpoint and increased S phase entry, apparently by activating the mitogen-independent Skp2 autoinduction loop. Specifically, GPC1 suppressed CDK inhibitors (CKIs), including p21, p27, p16, and p19, and the D cyclins, and induced CDK2 and Skp2. GPC1 may trigger the Skp2 autoinduction loop at least partially by suppressing p21 transcription as knockdown of p21 by RNAi can mimic the effect of GPC1 on the cell cycle regulators related to the loop. Moreover, multiple mitogenic signaling pathways, including ERK MAPK, Wnt and BMP signaling, were significantly stimulated by GPC1 as has been reported for Dally in Drosophila. Notably, the c-Myc oncoprotein, which is frequently up-regulated by both ERK and Wnt signaling and functions as a potent transcription repressor for CKIs as well as D cyclins, was also significantly induced by GPC1. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how GPC1 regulates the cell cycle and proliferation.},
