	abstract = {Insulin analysis is used in combination with glucose, C-peptide, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and proinsulin determination for the investigation of adult hypoglycemia. The most common cause is the administration of too much insulin or insulin secretagogue to a diabetic patient or inadequate caloric intake after administration of either. Occasionally there is a question as to whether hypoglycemia has been caused by an exogenous insulin—whether by accident, intent, or even malicious intent. While traditionally this was confirmed by a low or undetectable C-peptide in a hypoglycemic specimen, this finding is not entirely specific and would also be expected in the context of impaired counter-regulatory response, fatty acid oxidation defects, and liver failure—though beta-hydroxybutyrate levels can lend diagnostic clarity. For this reason, insulin is often requested. However, popular automated chemiluminescent immunoassays for insulin have distinctly heterogeneous performance in detecting analogue synthetic insulins with cross-reactivities ranging from near 0 \% to greater than 100 \%. The ability to detect synthetic insulins is vendor-specific and varies between insulin products. Liquid Chromatography and Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) offers a means to circumvent these analytical issues and both quantify synthetic insulins and identify the specific type. We present an immunoaffinity extraction and LC-MS/MS method capable of independent identification and quantitation of native sequence insulins (endogenous, Insulin Regular, Insulin NPH), and analogues Glargine, Lispro, Detemir, and Aspart with an analytical sensitivity for endogenous insulin of between 1 and 2 μU/mL in patient serum samples.},

	abstract = {Accurate determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) is essential for the development and maintenance of an effective screening program for primary aldosteronism (PA). PRA measurement can also be useful in the investigation of renal artery stenosis, syndrome of mineralocorticoid excess, Addison’s disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Bartter and Gitelman syndromes, and for inherited defects in the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). We describe a semi-automated and simple method for the accurate and precise measurement of PRA from 500 μL of plasma (250 μL if blank subtraction is omitted, as discussed) using a liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for angiotensin I (AngI) in 96-well format. After a 3 h AngI generation step at 37 °C in buffering conditions at pH 6, the reaction is quenched with 10 \% formic acid containing AngI internal standard. Sample preparation then proceeds with offline solid phase extraction, two wash steps, and methanol elution followed by injection into the LC-MS/MS system. Quantitation is performed against a 7-point calibration linear curve prepared in buffer. The assay calibration range is 0.34–30.0 ng/mL which corresponds to PRA values of 0.11–10.0 ng/mL/h: much wider than was possible using traditional competitive antibody-based methods. Total precision in clinical production has been observed to be 5.8 to 5.0 \% for Bio-Rad Hypertension Control materials having nominal PRA values ranging from 1.73 to 12.43 ng/mL/h. At AngI concentrations of 0.06 ng/L (corresponding to a PRA of 0.02 ng/mL/h), signal to noise ratios are 50:1 indicating that the limit of quantitation is well below the level required for clinical use.},

	abstract = {As with all other organ systems, the endocrine axes are subject to physiological and pathological changes with aging. The purpose of this chapter is to assist the reader in the diagnosis of the latter in the context of the former. That is, as physicians and laboratorians, we must be able to distinguish the normal effects of aging on the patient’s clinical presentation and biochemistry from those of disease states. Unfortunately, there are many contexts where normal aging and pathophysiology have phenotypic overlap to the point where the distinction between the two may become more philosophical than biomedical. To that end, this chapter will review the endocrine axes delineating some of the known physiological changes and their effect on reference intervals and diagnosis of specific disease entities. Particular attention will be paid to issues that commonly arise in clinical practice. Unfortunately some of the questions posed in clinical practice are generated from an industry of “wellness” and “antiaging” medicine that has found an entrepreneurial niche in some Western countries. Between the effects of trends in medical entrepreneurship and the rise in the average life span, these diagnostic challenges are becoming increasingly prevalent and the clinician must be prepared with a diagnostic strategy and approach in response to pressure to treat what may be entirely normal—where the treatment itself may have no proven scientific benefit and may pose risk of harm.},

Its measurement is also used in the investigation of adrenal incidentaloma, adrenal carcinoma, Addison’s disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, renal artery stenosis, and renal tubular channelopathies. We describe a simple and robust method for the accurate and precise measurement of aldosterone in serum or plasma using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After addition of internal standard, aldosterone is extracted from serum samples using supported liquid extraction (SLE) with methyl-t-butyl ether (MtBE). The MtBE is evaporated to dryness and sample is reconstituted with mobile phase before injection onto the LC-MS/MS and quantitation using an 8-point calibration curve. The assay calibration range is approximately 50–6500 pmol/L (0.16–234 ng/dL) with total imprecision between 6.8 and 4.1 \% for concentrations between about 50 and 1000 pmol/L respectively.},
